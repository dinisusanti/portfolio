## Projects
### Forcasting Indonesian Rupiah Against US Dollar Using ARIMA and LSTM during COVID-19 Pandemic
This is my final project (thesis) to obtain a master degree from Unversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. The project was supervised by Prof. Dr. Zaidi Isa who was also the lecturer for time series modelling and forecasting course where I had done preliminary assignments to show my technical skill performance. This project was evaluated by Prof. Dr. Noriszura Ismail and Mrs. Noriza Majid. The objective of this project is to develop ARIMA model and the right architecture of LSTM model, which best represents the USD/IDR exchange rate during COVID-19 pandemic. The method used to determine which one was the best between the two models was by comparing the evaluation metrics that were being used to measure error.

### Technical Analysis of LQ45 Index Stock from January to February 2022
This is a project in Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management course that was lectured by Associate Prof. Dr. Saiful Hafizah Jaaman. The objective of the project is to examine the technical analysis of closing price of LQ45, an index of stock market for Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) using Moving Average (MA) as the tool. The types of MA used in this project are Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The method used to determine the best analysis result is by inspecting the crossovers of two different periods, from three different periods available for each SMA and EMA, and the crossovers between SMA and EMA. The analysis also provides a short analysis of support and resistance levels for LQ45 index.

### Comparing ABM and GBM and Simulating Those Models on Closing Price Of AAPL
This is a project in Stochastic Processes that was lectured by Dr. Munira Ismail. The objective of the project is to understand the trend created by Arithmetic Brownian Motion (ABM) and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) models. The method used is by comparing graphs of both models for n = 50 and n = 2000. Then, using both models to simulate the projection Apple Inc. stock (AAPL) from January to December 2020.
